== A2003 Hybrid Cloud Management - Cost Management on AWS


`rhte2019-maa-hcm-cost-aws`

Welcome to the 2019 HCM Cost Management with OpenShift and AWS Lab

Red Hat is in the midst of developing SaaS offerings for our customer base all available at link:https://cloud.redhat.com[^] and link:https://cloud.openshift.com[^]. One of the early offerings will be Hybrid Cloud Cost Management (HCCM.) It is an Open Source project called "Koku" hosted at link:https://github.com/project-koku/[^] with documentation at link:https://koku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[^]

Cost Management reveals the true costs of Business Initiatives.  It does so by appropriately matching resources and their costs across varied platforms.  Resources are matched through common tagging and labeling of the resources used by an initiative and offering.  Once the matches are made, Cost Management appropriate reports on them. Most cloud platforms offer hourly reports on the costs of resources consumed, and when properly labeled and tagged, analysts can report on them. Further features like forecasting, price-markups, discounts (like AWS Reserve Instances) etc. are being developed now.

To understand and sell this product, Red Hatters will not only need to learn the the techincal details of deploying and managing this product, but Red Hatters will also need to gain facility with basic financial terminology and the problem domains that this product seeks to solve, including:

* Budgeting
* Forecasting
* Workload Optimization

A blog post series is being planned, with explanations of the theory and examples of the product in use.

Red Hat Global Partner and Technical Enablement (GPTE) will be producing on-line training, and itself will be a business use case for the product.  Learn more in upcoming blog posts.

=== Goals

In this lab you will:

* Walk through the setup of the Metering Operator on your own cluster
* Add your cluster as a "source" for cost related information to the Account
* Use labels and tags to associate OpenShift resources with AWS resource tags according to Business Initiatives
* Analyse of the existing Account's current costs per Business Initiative
* Forecast the cost of the Business's proposed Initiatives

[WARNING]
Hybrid Cloud Cost Managment is in the *BETA* state.  Not all features are expected to work.  Your suggestions for improvements and features are welcome.

[NOTE]
*OCP Usage Data Upload*
Upon General Availability, HCCM will upload usage data via the separate project OpenShift Telemetry (link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/telemetry/about-telemetry.html[OpenShift Telemetry^]).  Until the products are integrated and are GA, a sub-project called "katakura" is supplied by the Cost Management team to upload data from OpenShift to the HCCM SaaS.

=== Infrastructure and Accounts

* Your OCP4 Cluster - one small OCP4 cluster
** 1 Master, 3 workers, 1 bastion
** OpenShift Web Console: `admin` `rhte2019`
** Metering Operator already installed. Learn more at link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering[^]

* Your Bastion Host
** Bastion SSH: `lab-user` `rhte2019`
** OCP 4 Installer - already complete
** OCP `oc` client - `system:admin` keys setup
** Cost Collector (sub-project "katakura") already installed and configured

* Your AWS Sandbox Account
** CLI access ONLY (sorry)
** Details are custom to each student, via email
*** aws access key id
*** aws secret access key

* The Cost Management SaaS accounts served from link:https://cloud.redhat.com/hybrid/cost-management/[^] 
** Red Hat Tech Exchange - Management Business Unit Account 1 - Number: 6289400 (rhte19mbu1org)
*** Live data where you will add your clusters as a data source
** Account 2 - Number: 6289402 (rhte19mbu2org)
*** Static Sample data where you can see an example of Tags and Labels working together

=== Prerequisites

. Get a GUID from the GUIDGrabber. This is the GUID of your personal cluster.
* Cluster 1 has a bastion VM that you will use to execute all tasks.
* GUIDGrabber will show the command to connect to the bastion VM.
* Your cluster runs in a Sandbox. Make a note of the Sandbox Number.
** For example if GUIDGrabber shows the following command:
+
[source,sh]
----
ssh lab-user@bastion.b1fa.sandbox23.opentlc.com
----
+
this means that your GUID is b1fa and your Sandbox Number is 23.

== Examine Cost Management on AWS

Your cloud provider is the first stop in gathering cost information.  The Cost Management will support both AWS and Azure, with more platforms coming.  We'll focus on AWS.

AWS reports costs for consumption by third parties via a feature called "AWS Cost and Usage Reports."  The AWS root account can setup these reports, including the level of data detail and the AWS tags that are included. AWS generates CSV files and places them in special S3 buckets almost hourly.  Red Hat Cost Managemetn gathers these logs from the S3 bucket almost hourly and processes them.  Since you only have an AWS "linked" account, not a root account, you will not be able to alter the configuration of AWS cost reporting.  Sorry about that.  We'll do our best to show them to you.

Here's how they're setup in AWS and the Red Hat HCCM SaaS:

* Observe the Setup of AWS for Cost Management

== Connect OCP and HCCM

To upload data that the metering operator has collected into the Cost Management SaaS, we'll be using the Koku sub-project link:https://github.com/project-koku/korekuta[korekuta^].  Korekuta has several moving parts:

. Some custom reports for the reporting-operator in the metering-operator
. Shell scripts to run the collector
. Ansible playbooks to keep the shell scripts a sane length
. Cronjobs to collect data periodically
. A configuration of the `insights-client`.  It first sets up reports and then periodically reads the reports from the metering operator and uploads them to cloud.redhat.com with the `insights-client`.

We've already set all this up for you on your environment. (You're welcome.) Let's have a look at its configuration.

. The `ocp_usage.sh` script keeps its configuration data in the filesystem of the bastion host.  The directory names under `$HOME/.config/ocp_usage/` are the cluster identifiers.
+
.Examine the Configs
[source,bash]
----

<1> The `ocp_usage.sh` collector will access the OpenShift cluster through the API endpoing.  Get it with `oc whoami --show-server`
<2> The token that belongs to the service account that was created to display reports. Get it with `oc serviceaccounts get-token reporting-operator -n openshift-metering`
<3> The cluster identifier used between the `ocp_usage.sh` scripts and the HCCM SaaS.  Also the name of the parent directory.
<4> The Metering Operator namespace.
<5> The `oc` command line tool appropriate for accessing this cluster.  Might need an `oc` client version 3 for older clusters.
<6> Certs are optional, though encouraged.
<7> The Route to the Reporting system to gather report to upload via `insights-client`.  Get it with `oc get route -n openshift-metering metering -o=jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'

NOTE: If data for your cluster hasn't already populated, wait a few hours for Korekuta and AWS to deliver reports and Koku to process them.  Report frequencies are by the hour.  Initial reports can take up to four hours to sync properly.

== Business Use Cases and Cost Management

=== Red Hat Global Partner and Technical Enablement: ELTs and ILTs

GPTE is in the business of delivering training. GPTE delivers both online training (ELT) and in-person training (ILT).


Let's create a system to track the cost of each student's resource usage in the cloud as they take classes.

=== Cloud Resources: Shared Clusters and Dedicated Environments

When students take classes they use online lab environments to do the exercises taught in their classes.  The labs environemnts are hosted in the cloud.  The lab environments for each student can be provided by "Dedicated Environments" or "Shared Clusters," and sometimes both.

"Shared Clusters" are made up of resources shared with other students, on which they do their lab work. For example, students in a Shared Cluster are creating and deleting projects and associated OpenShift resources as part of their training.  Or perhaps, they might be sharing resources by pulling images from a common Quay registry.

"Dedicated Environments" are created for the student, and only the individual student has access to the resources. Oftentimes, these students are confined to a linked or "sandbox" account where they can create new cloud resources in a controlled fashion.

Classes can use Shared and/or Dedicated Resources to provide online environments to the students running labs as the lab creator sees fit. ELTs and ILTs can be taught by giving students access to a "Shared Cluster," or allowing the student to create new "Dedicated Environments".  Some use both "Shared Clusters" and "Dedicated Environments."

=== Cloud Tags and OpenShift Labels

.Default Values
By default, the Red Hat Cost Management service can detect which AWS EC2 instance IDs are being used by an OpenShift cluster.  This gives the user coarse grained information regarding the Cloud Resource consumption of the cluster.  This would be appropriate for the OCP-related costs of a student with a Dedicated Environment.  However, this does not give us precise knowledge of the students' activities in a Shared Cluster.

.Tags and Labels
To give us precise information as to the students' activities, GPTE needs a tagging system to ensure that the class lab environment that was used by the student is properly accounted for in the Cost Management system. As many as possible of the resourced need to be tagged or labeled, according to the features of the infrastructure providing them.

.Business Identifiers
Let's say that a student with ID `student1-redhat.com` is taking the *OpenShift 4 Foundations* ELT.  We need to label and tag all the resources they will be using for the course of the class.  We should choose a meaningful identifier for the student taking the class.  Let's say `class_session: student1-redhat.com_ocp4-foundations`

.Limitations
Each system has its own limitations in their tagging and labeling mechanisms.  The total number of tags or labels in a system may be limited.  The number of tags on a particular resource may be limited.  The character count and allowed characters may differ.  Care must be taken to create tags and labels that suit all the systems involved.


== Example Account - Data

=== Sample Account

Our sample account, which you have access to, can show you how OpenShift projects/namespaces are associated with AWS resources.

Using OpenShift labels and AWS tags you are expressing the relationship between student ILT clusters, the applications they're hosting, and the AWS resources that power them.

=== Sample Cluster

We have created same data for eight ILTs, each of which have two students who have deployed their own single OCP clusters. 

Each cluster has three masters, three worker nodes, and associated storage with tags called storageclass whicn represents EBS volumes and S3 storage.

Three "workload" projects were deployed on the clusters.  They are the basis of a sample "cost management" system and the OCP control plane:  The apps are install-test, cost-management, catalog, analytics.  The control plane is also represented by projects openshift, and kube-system.

[NOTE] You won't be looking at Cost Management data as instances of AWS resources - rather, you'll be presented with the cost derived from the tag and label associations that connect the OCP resources to underlying AWS resources.


=== Examine the data of the ILT clusters through the GUI:

* Log into the Sample Data Account

. Navigate to link:https://cloud.redhat.com/hybrid/cost-management/sources/[^]

. Log OUT of the previous user.

. Sign in as example user *2*: username `rhte-example-2` password `r3dh4t1!`

* All of the cluster data has already been loaded

* *Click* on *Cost Management* on the left to open up the five options and *Click* on *Overview.*  The Cost Management Overview page opens.

* Look at the "Infrastructure cost" graph, and note that it only covers this month and the last.  HCM Cost Management is currently designed for quick analysis of recent changes in spending.

* Using your mouse, determine which week-long time periods ILTs were run.  Note that sometimes the graph lines are unbroken. 

* Note which particular projects have cost the most money this month.

* *Click* on the *Top Clusters* tab and see the top spenders for the month.

* *Scroll Down* and observe the AWS resource utilization and the actual resource usage of all OCP projects compared to the resources requested by all OCP projects.

* On the left, click on *OpenShift on cloud details* and in the list of projects that opens, click the to open the first project name (usually "analytics") on the list.  Note how it identifies a single cluster and the spending per region of the projects.

* Continue working with the Cost Management GUI to try to answer the following questions:


== Business Analysis Scenario

NOTE: Note that this data is in some parts matched incorrecgly and faulty just for today, Tuesday's breakout, and can produce strange results. 

Senior Management wants to know:

* How much have we spent in the last month with AWS
* Infrastructure Cost per student to Run one OpenShift 4 ILT
* How many Students have done the OpenShift 4 "Foundations" ELT the past two months
* At current rate of usage increase, how much will we be spending on OpenShift 4 ELTs

== Congratulations!

This breakout has shown you the basics of the Cost Management system.  It covered the infrastructure setup and basic use of the product.

Don't forget to register your attendance in the app!!

[CAUTION] 
*Come to the Hack-a-thon on Thursday!*  If you are interested in the sample data cleaned up and want to work with it, we'll be featuring it there.  

WARNING:  Also!  *Do you want to Keep your cluster alive until Thursday?*  If you want to continue working withy your live cluster after this Breakout, see Judd and tell him your GUID.  He'll make sure your cluster is not retired, and you can use it until after the Hack-a-thon on Thursday.

NOTE: Remember, you can learn a lot more about Cost Management in the docs and blog posts indicated at the top of this document.
